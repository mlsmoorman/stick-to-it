What do you do when there are too many things to do and not enough time or organization to do them?  There always seems to be a lack of motivation out there to get everything done and it can become overwhelming without a tool to help get you organized and keep you motivated.

Meet Stick-To-It!  The app that's designed to help the everyday person with tasks they may otherwise forget.  It's designed to take individualized input from YOU the user and create a Stick-It note.  It could be grocery shopping, car maintenance reminders, bill pay and so much more!  All at your fingertips to make sure you Stick-To-It. 

The Stick-It notes are arranged in order of due date so you never second guess your next task.  Once complete you can click the checkbox and your Stick-It will automatically close and move to the Completed Tasks page, where you can view all completed task.  

Need to check off several items at once?  Not an issue - check away and take a peak at your Completed Tasks page once you're done to see all that you've accomplished!  

Make a mistake?  Check off a task you didn't mean to?  Easy enough!  You can click on a Stick-It from the Tasks or Completed page and make any updates, as needed.

Best part...there is a ticker to keep track of all of the tasks you've completed!  Keep on going and see how long you can Stick-To-It!!  Good luck!
